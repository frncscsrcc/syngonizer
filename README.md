Watch and sync files from your local env to one or more running containers on
a Kubernetes infrastructure.

*Note*: This is a WiP. This first version uses _kubectl_ to connect to the
running kubernetes cluster. In future it will be replaced with a better implementation,
based on the official kubernetes client API. But this is enough for a raining Sunday.

Documentation, configuration examples and hopefully unit tests will be added ASAP.

Made with <3 from and enthusiastic and naive Go developer.
